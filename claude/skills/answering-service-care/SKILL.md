description: Pick the right skill for a request about your answering service and say what this plugin can do. Use when a request is broad or unclear, when someone asks what you can help with, or when a job spans more than one skill.

# Pick the right skill

Match the request to one skill below, say which one you're using, then follow it. When
nothing fits, use the connector's tools directly. You see and change only what your login
can in the client portal, with or without a skill.

| The request | Skill |
|---|---|
| Catch up on messages, find anything urgent, work through unread ones | `message-triage` |
| Create and track follow-up to-dos or update message status | `message-triage` |
| Cover time off, swap or move a shift, who's on call tonight | `oncall-changes` |
| Review or change escalation levels, if authorized | `oncall-changes` |
| A new cell number, texts instead of calls, add or stop an email | `contact-delivery` |
| Check an ASC balance or find where to securely pay | `billing-handoff` |

**Someone wasn't reached:** check who was on call with `oncall-changes`, then how they are
reached with `contact-delivery`.

## When the question is how something works

Search the help center with `search_resources`, read the page with `read_resource_page`,
and link it in the answer.

When a task needs something the connector doesn't offer, say so and point the user to the
client portal rather than trying a workaround.
